# longbridge-ark-analysis

Prompt-only ARK-inspired diagnostic for a single ticker. Runs a suitability gate (must be a disruptive-innovation name), then builds TAM, a Wright's-Law cost-curve note, and a three-scenario 5-year target price. Closes with a mandatory data-source appendix whose final row is a one-line reconciliation summary.

> **Independence statement (mandatory)**: this skill is an independent implementation inspired by ARK Invest's publicly described methodology. It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or representative of ARK Invest or Cathie Wood's actual views or positions**. The independence statement must appear in the disclaimer of every output.

## Cognitive frame (do not skip)

ARK's reference is **5-year ownership of disruptive-innovation companies**, with three-scenario thinking around a TAM × market-share × margin × multiple terminal value, discounted back. Three things every output must surface:

1. **Suitability is a gate, not a soft preference.** If the company is not in one of ARK's five innovation platforms (**Artificial Intelligence · Robotics & Autonomous Mobility · Energy Storage & EV Adoption · Multiomic Sequencing & AI Drug Discovery · Public Blockchains & Digital Assets** — see `references/scoring.md` §Suitability for the value-chain decomposition into upstream / core / downstream / adjacent tiers, and the convergence themes), **reject** and recommend an alternative method — do not produce a "for reference" ARK report on a bank, oil major, or consumer staple. A company qualifies if its revenue depends materially on **any tier** of a platform (upstream / core / downstream / adjacent) — not only on being the platform's headline name.
2. **5-year predictions are wide ranges, not point estimates.** TAM and market share are deeply uncertain. The output always shows three scenarios (Bull / Base / Bear) with explicit assumptions; never collapse them to a single confident number, and never present the weighted target price as a forecast — call it a model-derived expectation.
3. **Many disruptors have short history — analyse them anyway, on forward inputs.** A large share of ARK-style names (RIVN, RXRX, IONQ, BEAM, NTLA, COIN post-pivot, PLTR's commercial-AI era) have 1–3 fiscal years of public history and live almost entirely in the **forward** thesis. The skill enters **Young-company mode** (see `references/scoring.md` §Young-company mode) and explicitly anchors on forward consensus, cash runway, dilution path, capacity roadmap, regulatory milestones, and customer pipeline — not on a backward 5-year operating-leverage curve. **Short history alone is not a rejection.** Reject reason C is reserved for genuinely pre-revenue names.

Three failure modes the user must be able to distinguish:

- **"Right platform, wrong company"** → platform fit strong but innovation revenue < 20% or no quantified management vision → ❌ reject; recommend a method that fits the actual revenue mix.
- **"Right company, framework limit (pre-revenue)"** → fits the platform but truly no commercial revenue base → ❌ reject (reason C); recommend an early-stage framework.
- **"Right company, short history but commercial"** → fits the platform, has commercial revenue, but < 3 yrs of public scale history → ✅ **enter Young-company mode**, do **not** reject.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve symbol** to `<CODE>.<MARKET>` (e.g. `TSLA.US`, `00700.HK`, `300750.SZ`).
2. **Sector triage** (decides mode + reject branch):
   - Traditional industry (bank / insurance / oil / real estate / staples / utilities not in energy-transition) → halt with reject reason **A — Traditional industry** (see `references/scoring.md` §Reject reasons).
   - Being-disrupted incumbent (e.g. ICE auto, fossil-fuel major, legacy media against streaming) → halt with reason **B — Being disrupted**.
   - Mature tech with disruption already priced in (e.g. mature consumer electronics supply chain) → halt with reason **D — Disruption premium already realised**.
   - **Truly pre-revenue** (no commercial product/service revenue, or revenue is < ~$10M annualised with no commercial path in 18 months) → halt with reason **C — Data basis insufficient**.
   - **Has commercial revenue but short public history** (listed < 3 fiscal years OR < 3 yrs of scale revenue OR recent business-model pivot OR post-SPAC < 12 months) → **enter Young-company mode** (see `references/scoring.md` §Young-company mode). Do **not** reject. The mode loosens history requirements and adds **mandatory forward-looking inputs** (forward consensus, cash runway, dilution path, capacity roadmap, regulatory milestones, customer pipeline).
   - **Standard mode** (commercial revenue + ≥ 3 yrs scale history + no recent pivot) → proceed without mode flag.
3. **Fetch raw data via Longbridge CLI first** (parallel where possible). See [§CLI](#cli). If `longbridge` is missing, fall back to MCP (see [§MCP fallback](#mcp-fallback)). Use WebSearch **only** for items genuinely outside Longbridge — TAM figures, Wright's-Law learning rates, qualitative management innovation signals, industry-runway evidence.
4. **Reconciliation gate** (勾稽校验) — runs **before** suitability scoring or any analysis. See [§Reconciliation](#reconciliation-勾稽校验). Two-state outcome:
   - **Pass (every check within tolerance)** → proceed. A one-line summary of the result still appears at the end of the data-source appendix.
   - **Fail (any check exceeds tolerance)** → halt all downstream analysis, emit a halt message naming the failing check and gap, still print the data-source appendix and the reconciliation summary describing the failure.
5. **Suitability scoring** — score 4 dimensions on 强/中/弱; apply the pass/reject matrix in `references/scoring.md` §Suitability. If Young-company mode is active, dimensions are evaluated on the available history (pro-rated, tagged in the appendix) and the **management-vision bar is raised** — quantified milestones + dated regulatory or commercial gates are now required for 强. If reject, emit the reject layout (see `references/output.md` §Reject case) with an alternative-method recommendation matched from `references/scoring.md` §Alternative-method matching. **Do not** produce a "for reference" ARK analysis on a rejected name.
6. **TAM** — three tiers (low / base / high), each tagged with a source priority (权威机构 > 公司自披露 > 学术/智库 > ARK 公开报告 > 估算). Estimation-only TAM must be explicitly labelled `估算`. See `references/scoring.md` §TAM rules.
7. **Wright's-Law note** — pick the technology learning rate from the table in `references/scoring.md` §Wright's Law and refresh it via WebSearch against the cited authority (BloombergNEF / IRENA / NHGRI / Epoch AI / ARK). Never use the embedded historical figure as the current value without verification.
8. **Three-scenario 5-year target** — Bull / Base / Bear with explicit (TAM, market share, net margin, terminal multiple) for each; weights 25 / 50 / 25 by default; discount rate 15% over 5 years; report each scenario price plus weighted expectation and upside/downside vs current price. See `references/scoring.md` §Scenario. **In Young-company mode**: year-5 share count uses the dilution path (not current shares); Bull CAGR must clear a 1.5× sell-side high-end sanity check or be flagged explicitly; Bear must include a runway-exhaustion sub-scenario if cash runway < 24 months.
9. **Forward-looking inputs panel (Young-company mode only)** — fetch the mode's required inputs (forward consensus, cash runway, 5-year dilution path, capex / capacity roadmap, regulatory / commercial milestone calendar, customer pipeline, technology-readiness signal). If any cannot be sourced, cap management-vision at 中 and say so in the report. See `references/output.md` §Forward inputs panel.
10. **Risks, action-frame, key observation node** — three concrete risks (in Young-company mode, at least one must come from the young-company sub-catalogue: cash runway / dilution / execution / tech-readiness gap), condition-based action sentences (no buy/sell command), one explicit next observation event/date.
11. **Output** the report from `references/output.md` — summary line → suitability → (forward-inputs panel if Young-company mode) → TAM → cost curve → 3 scenarios → risks → action frame → **Data Source Appendix (mandatory)** ending with the reconciliation summary line. Close with the ARK disclaimer variant matching the user's input language (single-language only — see `references/output.md` §Disclaimer variants).

### WebSearch fallback — only for items not available from Longbridge

ARK methodology depends heavily on third-party market-size and learning-rate data. WebSearch is **required** for TAM and Wright's-Law inputs; it must not be skipped to "save a step".

| Missing data                  | WebSearch query pattern                                              | Acceptable source authorities                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Sector TAM (general tech)     | `"<market name> market size 2030 Gartner"` `"<market name> TAM IDC"` | Gartner, IDC, Forrester, McKinsey Global Institute |
| Clean-energy TAM              | `"<segment> market size BloombergNEF"` `"<segment> 2030 IRENA"`      | BloombergNEF, IRENA                                |
| Battery learning rate         | `"battery learning rate" BloombergNEF`                               | BloombergNEF EV Outlook (latest annual)            |
| Solar PV learning rate        | `"solar PV learning rate" IRENA`                                     | IRENA Renewable Power Generation Costs             |
| DNA sequencing cost trend     | `"DNA sequencing cost" NHGRI`                                        | NHGRI cost database (latest update)                |
| AI compute / inference cost   | `"AI compute cost" learning rate "Epoch AI"`                         | Epoch AI, MLCommons, Stanford AI Index             |
| Autonomous-driving runway     | `site:ark-invest.com "autonomous" "Big Ideas"`                       | ARK Big Ideas (yearly, free)                       |
| Management innovation vision  | `"<CEO>" innovation roadmap shareholder letter`                      | Annual report, earnings call, IR deck              |
| Regulatory / policy overhangs | `"<sector> regulation <region> 2025"`                                | Government agency, FT, Reuters, WSJ                |

Every WebSearch-sourced figure must be tagged `[Source: WebSearch — <publisher>, <report name>, <year>, <url>]` in the appendix; never silently mix it with Longbridge data, never invent a publisher to dress up an internal estimate.

## Reconciliation (勾稽校验)

Before any suitability scoring, TAM construction, or target-price calculation, verify the fetched figures are internally consistent. Reconciliation is **user-visible in this skill** — a one-line summary always appears as the final row of the Data Source Appendix. If a check fails, all downstream analysis halts.

| Check                        | Formula                                                                                          | Tolerance                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| IS↔BS link                   | Net income(t) ≈ Δ Retained earnings(BS, t) − dividends paid(CF, t)                               | ±3%                                 |
| IS↔CF link                   | Net income + D&A + impairments + ΔWC ≈ Operating CF                                              | ±5%                                 |
| CF↔BS link                   | ΔCash from CF statement = Cash(t) − Cash(t−1) on BS                                              | ±1%                                 |
| Revenue segment sum          | Σ segment revenue ≈ total revenue                                                                | ±2%                                 |
| Innovation-revenue share     | Innovation-related revenue / total revenue used in suitability matches the segment-mix breakdown | exact (must match what you display) |
| R&D ratio                    | R&D expense / total revenue used in suitability matches the IS statement                         | exact                               |
| BS — current assets sum      | Cash + AR + Inventory + Other CA ≈ Total current assets                                          | ±2%                                 |
| BS — liabilities sum         | ST debt + LT debt + Other liabilities ≈ Total liabilities                                        | ±2%                                 |
| Market cap                   | `calc-index` shares × current price ≈ market cap from `quote`                                    | ±2%                                 |
| Period alignment             | All statements from the same fiscal period (or the lag is named)                                 | exact                               |
| TAM source-tagging           | Each TAM number has a source row in the appendix (机构 + 报告 + 年份, or `估算`)                 | exact                               |
| Learning-rate source-tagging | Wright's-Law learning rate has a source row (BloombergNEF / IRENA / NHGRI / Epoch AI / ARK)      | exact                               |

Output rules for reconciliation:

- **All pass within tolerance** → final appendix row uses the clean-pass variant from `references/output.md` §Reconciliation summary, rendered in the user's input language only.
- **Some residuals within tolerance but material to displayed figures** → final appendix row lists each material residual on its own sub-line (which figure it affects).
- **Any check fails > tolerance** → halt all analysis; emit the halt message defined in `references/output.md` §Reject case-reconciliation and still print the appendix with the reconciliation summary describing the failure.
- **Young-company mode**: the 12 checks still apply, but rows that span more periods than the company has are pro-rated and tagged `history-limited (N quarters)` in the appendix; the reconciliation **summary line** still uses the standard ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ variants — there is no separate young-company variant.

## Output

ARK-style diagnostic with 7 fixed sections (full template in `references/output.md`):

1. **Header + one-line conclusion** — platform attribution, weighted 5-year target, upside/downside vs current price, the one-line "core bet" sentence.
2. **Suitability check** — 4 dimensions (platform fit / innovation revenue / R&D intensity / management vision) each tagged 强 / 中 / 弱, with one-line evidence.
3. **TAM** — three tiers with source tags and a plain-language analogy.
4. **Wright's-Law cost curve** — technology domain, learning rate with cited authority, current cost position, plain-language interpretation.
5. **5-year target — three scenarios** — Bull / Base / Bear table with explicit (market share, net margin, terminal multiple), weighted expectation, current price, upside/downside.
6. **Main risks** — 3 concrete, named risks (not generic boilerplate).
7. **Action frame + key observation node** — condition-based sentences only ("if you believe X, then current price implies Y"); never a buy/sell directive. Plus one explicit next observation event/date.

Followed by the **Data Source Appendix (mandatory)** — every figure in sections [1]–[7] traceable to a row with source, fetch time, period, and (for WebSearch rows) URL; **final row is the reconciliation summary line** (pass / within-tolerance residual list / or failure description).
