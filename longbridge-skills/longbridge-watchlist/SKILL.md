# Longbridge Watchlist

Watchlist, price alerts, and community stock lists via the Longbridge CLI.

> **Response language**: match the user's input language — English / Simplified Chinese / Traditional Chinese.
> **RULE: Response language priority**: English is the default when language is ambiguous. If the user input is only a slash command, command name, ticker / symbol, or contains no natural-language language signal, you MUST respond in English. Do not infer Chinese from trigger keywords, skill metadata, or examples.

## When to use

Trigger when user asks about: viewing watchlist groups, adding or removing symbols from watchlist, creating or renaming or deleting watchlist groups, setting price alerts, listing alerts, deleting alerts, or working with community stock lists (sharelist).

## Sub-topic Routing

| User intent | Load references file |
|---|---|
| View / manage watchlist groups | references/watchlist.md |
| Price alerts | references/alert.md |
| Community stock lists | references/sharelist.md |

## CLI Commands

Run `longbridge <cmd> --help` for current flags and output fields.

### `watchlist` — list groups; create / rename / delete groups; add / remove symbols 🔐 ⚠️ mutating
### `alert` — list price alerts; add / delete alerts 🔐 ⚠️ mutating
### `sharelist` — list community stock lists; detail / create / delete / manage 🔐 ⚠️ mutating

## Auth requirements

All watchlist operations: 🔐 Requires `longbridge auth login` (Quote permission minimum).

## ⚠️ Mutating operation protocol

For any create / rename / delete / add / remove operation:

1. **Preview** — describe the planned action and what will change
2. **Wait** — do not execute until the user explicitly confirms ("yes", "确认", "ok")
3. **Execute** — run the command only after confirmation
4. **Report** — confirm the action completed

Never skip step 2. If the user's intent is ambiguous, ask rather than assume.

## Error handling

| Situation | Response |
|---|---|
| `command not found: longbridge` | Install longbridge-terminal |
| `not logged in` | Run `longbridge auth login` |
| Group not found | List available groups first with `longbridge watchlist` |

## MCP fallback

Use MCP server if CLI unavailable. Discover tools at runtime.
